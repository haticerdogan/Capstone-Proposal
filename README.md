# Capstone-Proposal

#Proposal 1: 
Using Instacart Market Basket data, https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data?select=aisles.csv.zip, I want to predict which products will be in users' next order. I also want to build a model to stock the store so there are never any product shortages, but no wasted space or money in ordering. So supplying the store based on the customer demand. I also want to predict users' healthiness from order contents and make a recommender system for healthier order alternatives.


#Proposal 2: 
Using Seattle Airbnb data, https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle?select=listings.csv, Time Series forecasting to answer questions like: What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike? and also predict airbnb ratings using NLP on customer reviews.
